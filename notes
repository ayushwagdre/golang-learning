// var first map[string]interface{} -- declares a nil map and requires initialization before you can use it.
// first1 := make(map[string]interface{}, 0) -- initializes an empty map with an explicitly specified initial capacity of 0, which can be useful if you have a specific use case for maps with expected small sizes.

// first2 := map[string]interface{}{} -- 	create empty maps with no initial memory allocation. Memory is allocated dynamically as you add elements.

// first3 := make(map[string]interface{}) -create empty maps with no initial memory allocation. Memory is allocated dynamically as you add elements.

// closure :-A closure is a function value that references variables from its surrounding lexical scope
// When a function is defined within another function, it forms a closure.
// The inner function has access to the variables of the outer (enclosing) function, even after the outer function has finished execution. The inner function "closes over" these variables.
